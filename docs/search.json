    "text": "Pick some subset of the information covered in your annual review article that you are interested in exploring in more detail.\nIdentify the scope of your user guide - what will you cover? Specific software packages? When to use or not to use a specific technique?\nI will explain the balance property when using the Exponential Distribution Family for GLMs in actuarial science. The balance property of GLMs in the exponential family means that the total expected losses equal the total expected pure premiums. The pure premium can be thought of as the portion of the premium that is intended only to cover expected losses, before any adjustments for expenses, risk load, or profit. In this sense, the balance property says that the sum of these unadjusted premiums across all policies matches the expected total losses.\nI will introduce the idea using a simple table to show that individual observed losses do not have to necessarily equal their fitted expected losses, but that the fitted expected losses balance correctly when summed across all policies. In actuarial terminology, these fitted expected losses are referred to as pure premiums.\nI will then run some of these GLMs in R probably using a few different distributions in the exponential distribution family, and show that this balance property actually holds in practice.\nI will also maybe lay out an actual problem involving this in actuarial science and show the balance property holding there, and the implications of what it helps and why it is so important.",

    "text": "C.1 Additional Guidance\nHere are some questions to guide you through the process of doing a task analysis. You don’t have to specifically answer each one of these (and some may not apply), but they should get you started thinking in the right direction.\nWhat are the prerequisites, for both knowledge and e.g. software setup?\nWhat are the basic requirements for any data that the method is used on? - Are missing values allowed? - Should the data be confined within a certain range? - Does the data have to be approximately normally distributed?\nWhat are the basic components of the task? - Outline these in a bit more detail\nWhat decisions does the user need to be prepared to make on the fly?\nWhat questions should the user ask of the “first draft” of the product? What adjustments may need to be made?\nYour check-in should answer these basic questions (and similar concerns that apply more directly to your topic).\nOnce you’ve completed the check-in, you can use this section to jump-start an introduction/set-up/getting started section in your user guide. This document should remain as an appendix to your main report.",
