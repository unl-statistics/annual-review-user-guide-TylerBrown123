    "text": "C.1 Additional Guidance\nHere are some questions to guide you through the process of doing a task analysis. You don’t have to specifically answer each one of these (and some may not apply), but they should get you started thinking in the right direction.\nWhat are the prerequisites, for both knowledge and e.g. software setup?\nWhat are the basic requirements for any data that the method is used on? - Are missing values allowed? - Should the data be confined within a certain range? - Does the data have to be approximately normally distributed?\nWhat are the basic components of the task? - Outline these in a bit more detail\nWhat decisions does the user need to be prepared to make on the fly?\nWhat questions should the user ask of the “first draft” of the product? What adjustments may need to be made?\nYour check-in should answer these basic questions (and similar concerns that apply more directly to your topic).\nOnce you’ve completed the check-in, you can use this section to jump-start an introduction/set-up/getting started section in your user guide. This document should remain as an appendix to your main report.\nThere are a few prerequistites in terms of knowledge that a reader of the user guide should be familiar with.\nThe first is a base knowledge of the exponential family of GLMs. They need not have the entire realm of canonical link, dispersion parameter and all these such theoretical aspects, but rather just must have a base knowledge of the distributions in the exponential family and that they all follow this rule. Nested in this step, they must also have just the base knowledge of what a GLM is and what it does.\nOn a slightly different note, they should have a base knowledge of insurance and what is entails. They need not be an actuary, but rather they just need to have a base knowledge of what losses and premiums are.\nFrom a software standpoint, the reader only needs to have R and some template for R (such as RStudio). No specific packages are needed as glm() is in the stats package that is embedded into R when it starts.\nMissing values will simply be dropped by glm() if they exist. If the response or predictor variable contain missing values, glm() will simply drop them and only use the others. Therefore missing values should be dealt with before, either with best practice on what should be entered there, or omitting the row entirely beforehand. Also, if your predictor and response are not in the same data frame, and don’t have the same number of values, glm() will give an error.\nThe observed data need to be in the range of whatever distribution you are fitting. For example, if you are fitting a poisson GLM, all of your observed values should be non-negative integers. This implies that a normality assumption is not necessary unless you are fitting a normal distribution of course.\nThe basic components of the task will be fitting a GLM with each of the main distributions in the exponential family and showing that it holds no matter which one you use. Essentially a short crash course in the use of GLMs in R and this nice property that is useful in insurance. I’ll show from a straight up statistical perspective first then connect the numbers to actual insurance metrics that would make sense given the scenario.\nThe user of the user guide should be prepared to decide based on the data which GLM is most appropriate for the data (Note that the balance property will technically hold even under a misspecified GLM but this leads to issues in the real world application, so it should be avoided).\nThe user should evaluate this user guide in terms of how well they understand the idea of the balance property in GLMs. Do they understand what each side of the equality actually is in the context of insurance? Do they understand that this holds for every distirbution in the exponential family? Could they apply this to actual insurance data?",

    "text": "1.1 Step 1\nReaders of this user guide should have a basic understanding of what generalized linear models (GLMs) are used for and how they function. An advanced knowledge of the underlying mathematics is not required, but familiarity with their general application is assumed.\nReaders should also have a general understanding of basic insurance terminology, particularly the terms losses1 and claims.2 Definitions of these terms are provided in the footnotes.\nThe balance property for GLMs means that for a model with an intercept, the sum of the observed values used in the model equals the sum of the fitted values from the model.\n\\(\\sum y_i = \\sum \\hat{\\mu}_i\\)\nThis result is extremely useful in the field of actuarial science, as it ensures that the model’s predicted losses/claims for the observed time period sum to what the observed losses/claims were for that time period. For example, assume we observe the number of car insurance claims made by three different age groups across one year. A table showing the observed claims and predicted claims could look as follows:\nAs we can see, the estimates for the number of claims from each age group does not necessarily equal the observed number of claims from that age group, but rather the total sum of predicted claims equals the sum of the observed claims. This result is valuable because it guarantees that predicted claims are fairly distributed across each age group without changing the overall total. A model that altered the total when predicting would be less useful because it would be harder to compare predicted estimates to the observed value, as their magnitudes would mean different things relative to their total.\nThe steps for proving the balance property in GLMs are as follows:\nWe will now show an example of performing this process using some simulated car insurance data.\nAccording to the 1st step we will simulate a data set that has 2 predictors, Age Group and Vehicle Type. We also simulate the number of observed claims for each person.\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(999)\n\n# Number of people\nn &lt;- 1000\n\n# Predictors\nAgeGroup &lt;- sample(c(\"&lt;20\", \"20-30\", \"31-40\", \"41-50\", \"&gt;50\"), n, replace = TRUE)\nVehicleType &lt;- sample(c(\"Sedan\", \"SUV\"), n, replace = TRUE)\n\n# Simulate observed claims (Poisson)\nlambda &lt;- 1 + \n  ifelse(AgeGroup == \"&lt;20\", 1, 0) + \n  ifelse(AgeGroup == \"20-30\", 0.5, 0) +\n  ifelse(VehicleType == \"SUV\", 0.5, 0)\n\nclaims &lt;- rpois(n, lambda)\n\n# Put data together\ncar_data &lt;- data.frame(claims, AgeGroup, VehicleType)\nWe could have set lambda to simply be a constant number for every person. This is however quite unrealistic as the predictors should have some influence on the average number of claims per person. As such, we add ifelse statements to increase the mean based on certain values of predictors. The baseline mean is 1, but if the age group is “&lt;20” then we add 1 to the mean. If the age group is “20-30” then we add 0.5 to the mean. If the Vehicle Type is “SUV” then we add 0.5 to the mean. This simply attempts to add some realism to the data.\nAfter we are done with this, we put all the data into a data frame that we call car_data. Below is what your data should be formatted like:\nhead(car_data)\n\n  claims AgeGroup VehicleType\n1      0    31-40       Sedan\n2      3    41-50         SUV\n3      3      &gt;50         SUV\n4      2      &lt;20         SUV\n5      1      &lt;20       Sedan\n6      4    20-30       Sedan",

    "text": "Pick some subset of the information covered in your annual review article that you are interested in exploring in more detail.\nIdentify the scope of your user guide - what will you cover? Specific software packages? When to use or not to use a specific technique?\nI will explain the balance property when using the Exponential Distribution Family for GLMs in actuarial science. The balance property of GLMs in the exponential family means that the total expected losses equal the total expected pure premiums. The pure premium can be thought of as the portion of the premium that is intended only to cover expected losses, before any adjustments for expenses, risk load, or profit. In this sense, the balance property says that the sum of these unadjusted premiums across all policies matches the expected total losses.\nI will introduce the idea using a simple table to show that individual observed losses do not have to necessarily equal their fitted expected losses, but that the fitted expected losses balance correctly when summed across all policies. In actuarial terminology, these fitted expected losses are referred to as pure premiums.\nI will then run some of these GLMs in R probably using a few different distributions in the exponential distribution family, and show that this balance property actually holds in practice.\nI will also maybe lay out an actual problem involving this in actuarial science and show the balance property holding there, and the implications of what it helps and why it is so important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments/suggestions\n\n\n\nDefinitely focus on the actual problem. Make sure that you illustrate lots with your user guide - pictures will help as much if not more than equations. Write for someome familiar enough with actuarial terminology, but I might need you to do “for dummies” footnotes so that I can understand it :).",

    "text": "What does someone trying to accomplish your chosen task need help with?\nWhat parts are likely to be tricky?\nWhat resources are already available on this topic that may be helpful? Look for e.g. software vignettes, package documentation, papers about software packages, and so on.\nSomeone trying to accomplish this task is likely someone that struggles with how to fit GLMs altogether in R, or possibly people that are unsure of what each part of the balance property actually refers to in terms of the code/data (this was confusing to me at first).\nSome things that may be quite tricky are understanding what the balance property actually means. Even when I saw it at a first glance, I misunderstood what it really meant. It is easy to get confused and think that the GLM is somehow perfectly matching the fitted values to the observed ones when rather the sum of all of them are simply equal.\nThe idea of “pure premiums” may also be tricky because using the word “premium” makes it seem as though this is what the customer pays when in reality, this “pure premium” is adjusted largely for variance, risk, and profit for the company.\nAs far as just GLMs are concerned, R has a help page about GLMs that is very useful for understanding the process and syntax. Simply type ?glm in the console.\nAs far as the balance property’s usefulness in actuarial science, the article at https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040120-030244#m0003 covers why the balance property is so useful in insurance.",

Please leave the topic.qmd file as an appendix, to document the different stages of this project.\nOnce we’ve agreed on a topic for your user guide, you will proceed to needs.qmd and task-analysis.qmd. Both will be submitted at the same check-in, and both will be included in your final report as appendices. You should be able to re-purpose most of the information in task-analysis.qmd to orient the user to different components of the task you’ve chosen.\nYour next step is to actually write the content that satisfies the work you outlined in task-analysis.qmd.\nOnce you’re finished with that, ideally, you’ll have plenty of time to edit and streamline your report. Feel free to trade reports with a friend and try to complete your friend’s task - this will help you both identify areas where the guide isn’t as clear. Try to complete the task with a different data set - that often helps find trouble spots.\nWhen you submit your final report, you may remove index.qmd from the _quarto.yml file, which will remove this chapter (which is quite unnecessary for your user) from the report. You should also take the time to make sure your name is listed as both author and copyright holder in the _quarto.yml file. Feel free to make a custom cover for your manual if you would like to do so. You can also tweak the CSS/theme for the book, so long as you’re conscious of accessibility concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the report\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio to complete this report, you can hit (Ctrl/Cmd)-Shift-B to build the whole report.
